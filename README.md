# Solar System Simulation

This is a 3D simulation of the solar system using C++. I am trying to emulate the behaviour of the real solar system as much as possible. It is rendered using OpenGL and GLFW, however, there is an abstraction layer that allows for switching to other rendering libraries or solutions.

You can build and run the project as follows:
```bash
make build
make run
```
